Space Pixel

- A space ship 3D voxel game minecraft clone because.

- Build a ship from first principles, mining ore and processing it.
- Break orbit.
- Build an FTL drive (which are massive and require LOTS of power and rare materials)
- Explore the galaxy

Entity Hierarchy
* Galaxy -> Solar System -> Planets
* Load/unload solar system when far away.
* Load/unload planet when far away (replace with simple sphere).

Entities
* Voxel sphere generation with gravity.

Blocks
* Dirt, Stone, Bedrock, Ore, Uranium Ore, Copper Ore
* Fabricator, Fission Reactor, Ion Drive, Airlock, Pipe, Wiring, Steel, Pilot Seat

Ships
* Need a power core and engines connected with pipes. Uranium powers the fuel cells.
* Need a pilot seat, moves to an overview when sitting in pilot seat. Pilot seat connected to power core with wires.
* Engines determine speed, doesn't need to be realistic.

Fabricator
* Produces items from ore. Ore is placed inside, you select which block type to generate. Gradually generates blocks.

Player
* Has a spacesuit with jetpack which only works in short bursts but has unlimited fuel. You'll need a ship to break orbit, but they are also affected by gravity.

* File format made up of two files:
	* A file 'map' of chunk position int hash -> file offset
	* File containing chunk data
		* Nearby chunks get plonked together!

Crafting
* Need a tech tree of crafting!
	* Stone -> Concrete
	* 4x Concrete -> Fabricator
	* 8x Concrete -> Smelter
	* Iron Ore -> (smelter) -> Steel Block
	* 9 x Steel Block + 6 x Uranium + 3 x Copper -> (fabricator) -> Fission Reactor
	* Copper Ore -> (smelter) -> Copper Block
	* Copper Block -> (fabricator) -> 4 x Wiring
	* Steel Block -> (fabricator) -> 4 x Pipe
	* Steel Block + Copper Ingot -> (fabricator) -> Airlock
	* Steel Block + Copper Ingot -> (fabricator) -> Pilot Seat

* KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID. FOCUS SHOULD BE ON SHIPS.
	* 4x Stone -> Fabricator
	* Stone -> Concrete
	* Iron Ore -> (fabricator) -> Steel Block
	* Uranium Ore -> Fuel Rod
	* Steel -> (fabricator) -> Airlock, (1/16 x) Power Core, 4x Power Conduit???


* Mine resources (Dirt, Stone, Iron Ore, Uranium Ore, Copper Ore)
	* Dirt + Stone x 2 + Iron x 8 + Copper x 6 -> Matter
	* Uranium -> Fuel Pellet
	* Blocks get CHIPPED AWAY
* You place and construct prefabs by firing your matteriser laser, which eats up your matter resources.
	* Complex, exotic blocks/prefabs eat more matter.
* Big question is, how do you start a new ship???
	* Place a foundation, which is an 8x8x1 flat block, which is a separate entity.
	* Build the spaceship out of the components.
	* Moving the space ship breaks the foundation connection, allowing you to build another ship, or just a building.

* Foundation Entity
	* A layer of concrete is generated on bottom layer, blocks cannot be placed below it.
	* Climbing into pilot seat destroys the bottom layer and inits a ship entity (should be no difference?)
* Ship Entity
	* Multiple pilot seats, thrusters and reactor cores.
	* Pilot seat contains ship movement logic.
	* Power simulation through wires to power ship systems (fluid sim, blocks add/remove energy)
	* Air simulation (fluid sim, blocks add/remove air)
	* Light transport (flood fill AGAIN but with blur averaging, iterative AGAIN)

TODO:

* Need to map from planet point to voxel point correctly.
* Add player jet pack
* Planet surface generation w/ multiple radii (1, 2, 4, 8 ???)
	* Add support for multiple block types
	* 3D height noise
		* Need grass on top layer
		* Blocks with different textures on each face, differing per planet angle.
* Ship creation
	* Placement of shipyard
		* Placement on planet surface
		* Also useful for building construction
	* Reactor core prefab
	* Pilot seat
	* Engine
* Investigate voxel chipping (solid, wedge x 12 rotations, corner x 8)
	* Mining rules: solid -> wedge x 2 -> corner x 2
	* Nearest edge is chipped away.
