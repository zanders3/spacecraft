Space Pixel

- A space ship 3D voxel game minecraft clone because.

- Build a ship from first principles, mining ore and processing it.
- Explore a voxel asteroid field galaxy thing also with planets and gravity on them.
- Basically minecraft with mining for important minerals with a space theme.

Entities
* Voxel sphere generation with gravity.

Blocks
* Grass, Dirt, Stone, Iron Ore, Uranium Ore, Copper Ore
* Fabricator, Nuclear Reactor Core, Ion Drive, Airlock, Pipe, Wiring, Steel Plating, Steel, Pilot Seat

Ships
* Need a power core and engines connected with pipes. Uranium powers the fuel cells.
* Need a pilot seat, moves to an overview when sitting in pilot seat. Pilot seat connected to power core with wires.
* Engines determine speed, doesn't need to be realistic.

Fabricator
* Produces items from ore. Ore is placed inside, you select ship blocks to generate. Gradually generates blocks.

Player
* Has a spacesuit with jetpack which only works in short bursts but has unlimited fuel. You'll need a ship to break orbit. Ships are not affected by gravity?

TODO:
* Entity with child block generation.
* Entities can be fixed or can move. All have a voxel grid relative to themselves.

* Chunk streaming to/from disk/generator according to distance???
* Planet CHUNKS that gradually curve around (D: how hard is this to do w/ a depth limit?)
	* Find base voxel
	* Compute normal and position of base voxel
	* Multiply by height
* Need to map from planet point to voxel point correctly.
